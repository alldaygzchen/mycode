If creating a node: declare ListNode()  
1. two pointer techinique is often used  #19,21,134,206
2. Set an dummy listNode(0) at first #19(delete purpose),2,21(better solution)
3. curr.next in while loop will exceed condition #19
4. hashmap #138
5. Floyd's algorithm find the beginning of cycle

Think:#287
